# Interviewing Notes

## Before applying

### Questions to ask yourself

- What do you like about your current job?
- What do you want in your next job?
- Which companies have appealing engineering cultures?

## Why frontend interviewing is so difficult

- Frontend is very broad (all thinkable devices have a frontend)
- Frontend tech changes very fast
- There does not seem to be a clear definition of frontend concepts between engineers. 

## Resume

- Keep it limited to one page
 - Skills
 - Experience
 - Projects / tech you've worked with

## Preparing

- Ask how many steps are in the interview process?
- How big is the team?
- Who are the competitors?
- What sort of projects will I be working on?
- What subjects will I face in my technical interview so that I can prepare
