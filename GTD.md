Notes From The Book
===============================

The usual reason you can't get anything out of your thoughts is that you want things to be different than they currently are.

Three models to decide what to do.

1. Four categories for actions in the now
    • Place
    • Time
    • Energy
    • Priority

2. Three types of daily work
    • To perform previously defined tasks
    • To perform tasks as they come up
    • To define tasks (go through and process inboxes)

3. Six perspective on your work
    • 20.000 meters: Life
    • 15.000 meters: visions at three to five years view
    • 10.000 meters: goals at one to two years view
    • 5.000 meters: responsibilities
    • 3.000 meters: current projects
    • Ground level: current operations

Important  principles when brainstorming
• Avoid judging, questioning, evaluating and critiscising
• Assume quantity, not quality
• Wait with analysis and organization

Little review is better than no review

There are no interruptions. There are simply mismanaged occurrences

The Moment to moment balancing act: At a master level, you can shift like lightning from one foot to the other. /Like karate kid!/
